* **Collect raw audio** in full-length recordings (e.g., `387_20201207_cut.wav`)
* **Manually annotate** each raw recording for hum-like vocalisations, marking segment start and end times in seconds
* **Export labelled files**: for each annotated segment, save a copy named

  ```
  originalFilename.wav_startTime[s]_endTime[s].wav
  ```

  under `labelled_recordings/`
* **Crop hum segments** from labelled recordings to produce “only hum” clips
* **Assign quality scores** to each cropped segment and append as `Q[quality]` in the filename:

  ```
  originalFilename.wav_start_end[s]_[segmentStart]_[segmentEnd]Q[quality].wav
  ```
* **Organize directory structure**:

  ```
  raw_recordings/
  labelled_recordings/
  segmented_wav_onlyhums/
  ```
* **Filter audio content** to 0–4000 Hz to retain only the hum-relevant band
* **Compute spectrograms** using a Hann window of 2002 samples (41.7 ms) with 50% overlap (hop size = 1001 samples) on the filtered clips
